# Fantasy-Books

Fantasy-Books is a teamwork (of 2) project for our first web application course during our first semester.

We created a website that talks about fantasy books. There are many fun interactions, quizzes and effects!

The website can be viewed [here](https://wan-mei-t.github.io/Fantasy-Books/index.html "Fantasy Books").
