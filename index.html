				<h2>Into the World of Fantasy Books</h2>

				<h3>What is Fantasy?</h3>
				<p>
				Though it is a fairly wide genre, to sum it up, the fantasy genre
				usually has magical elements that cannot be explained using any sicence
				whatsoever. Many people often confuse fantasy with the sci-fi genre. But
				it is important to remember that sci-fi elements usually have a somewhat
				plausible scientific explanation to justify whatever out-of-the-ordinary
				things are happening. Fantasy, on the other hand, cannot do that. One of
				the most popular fantasy series is Harry Potter - I'm sure most of you
				have heard about it. However, this page will let you explore the
				sub-genres of fantasy that arent talked about that often.

					<dt>Urban Fantasy</dt>
					<dd>
						The urban fantasy subgenre is my personal favourite and can be applied
						to many books. This genre is usually set in our actual world, not a
						world created by the author, and the magical or supernatural elements
						exist in our world as well. Therefore, there is usually a collision
						between our world and the magical world. One of my personal favourites
						in this genre is
						<div class="links">
							<a href="these-violent-delights.html">These Violent Delights by Chloe Gong</a>
						</div>
					</dd>
				</div>
				
				<div class="hidden-zoom">
					<dt>Dark Fantasy</dt>
					<dd>
						This genre of fantasy is, well, darker than the rest. It often
						involves exploring more disturbing and gory themes of fantasy. Because
						of this, the atmosphere is often gloomy, usually edging on thriller or
						horror genres. One of my favourites in this genre is 
						<a href="the-atlas-six.html">The Atlas Six by Olivie Blake!</a>
					</dd>
				</div>
				
				<div class="hidden-zoom">
					<dt>High Fantasy</dt>
					<dd>
						The High Fantasy genre is a much broader genre that can be
						incorporated with many other subgenres. In high fantasy, there is
						usually a system with rules. By this, I mean that the use of magic, or
						the magical elements of this world, have limits and consequences. This
						usually means that the fantasy aspect doesn't necessarily make the
						characters' lives easier, but instead poses problems and adds suspense
						and intrigue. One of my favourites within this genre is 
						<a href="six-of-crows.html">Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo</a>
